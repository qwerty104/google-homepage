This is my first attempt at the deconstructing and subsequent rebuilding of a webpage. This is part of a lesson from The Odin Project.
This is an attempt to become more familiar with CSS and element placement for HTML pages. Don't expect too much at this time, but feel free to follow along with my progress.
